 * Background: The Global System for Mobile communications is the most widely
 * deployed cellular telephony system in the world. GSM makes use of
 * four core cryptographic algorithms, neither of which has been published by
 * the GSM MOU. This failure to subject the algorithms to public review is all  
 * the more puzzling given that over 100 million GSM
 * subscribers are expected to rely on the claimed security of the system.
 *
 * The four core GSM algorithms are:
 * A3		authentication algorithm
 * A5/1		"strong" over-the-air voice-privacy algorithm
 * A5/2		"weak" over-the-air voice-privacy algorithm
 * A8		voice-privacy key generation algorithm
 *
 * In April of 1998, our group showed that COMP128, the algorithm used by the
 * overwhelming majority of GSM providers for both A3 and A8
 * functionality was fatally flawed and allowed for cloning of GSM mobile
 * phones.
 * Furthermore, we demonstrated that all A8 implementations we could locate,
 * including the few that did not use COMP128 for key generation, had been
 * deliberately weakened by reducing the keyspace from 64 bits to 54 bits.
 * The remaining 10 bits are simply set to zero!
 *
 * See http://www.scard.org/gsm for additional information.
 *
 * The question so far unanswered is if A5/1, the "stronger" of the two
 * widely deployed voice-privacy algorithm is at least as strong as the
 * key. Meaning: "Does A5/1 have a work factor of at least 54 bits"?
 * Absent a publicly available A5/1 reference implementation, this question
 * could not be answered. We hope that our reference implementation below,
 * which has been verified against official A5/1 test vectors, will provide
 * the cryptographic community with the base on which to construct the
 * answer to this important question.
 *
 * Initial indications about the strength of A5/1 are not encouraging.
 * A variant of A5, while not A5/1 itself, has been estimated to have a
 * work factor of well below 54 bits. See http://jya.com/crack-a5.htm for
 * background information and references.
 * 
 * With COMP128 broken and A5/1 published below, we will now turn our attention
 * to A5/2. The latter has been acknowledged by the GSM community to have
 * been specifically designed by intelligence agencies for lack of security.
