# A51/1 Cipher
![A5/1 schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzobn/gsm-a51/main/a5_schema.png)
<br>
This code is an implementation of the A51/1 cipher that doesn't focus on hardware performance.
<br>
<br>
This implementation aims to provide some modifications to the code I found online on this page called [A5/1 Pedagogical Implementation](https://cryptome.org/jya/a51-pi.htm), provided by Marc Briceno, Ian Goldberg, and David Wagner.
