# Rivest Cipher 4 aka RC4

The goal of this repository is to aid in understanding how the RC4 looks when compiled in C++. This repository contains compiled executable files, their corresponding PDB files and a link to the original source code.  It is recommend to download all files, open up the executable in IDA, load the PDB file and then compare the source code. For individuals not familiar with AES, I would recommend checking out the references.
